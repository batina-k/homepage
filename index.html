  <h3>Intro &#10024;</h3>
  <p>
    Hello everyone! My name is Batina. I am a student at
    <abbr title="University of Cincinnati Blue Ash">UCBA</abbr>. 
    My major is Pre-Business Administration. I’m curious about how companies work, how management is built and what skills are needed to be successful in this field. Studying isn’t always easy, but I really enjoy learning new things and seeing my own progress.
  </p>
  <h3>Why I love UC &hearts;</h3>
  <p>I enjoy studying at <a href="https://www.uc.edu/">UCBA.</a> I like small classes, it help me focus and understand the material better. I also appreciate that I can combine school with work and slowly gain experience that will be useful in the future.</p>
  <h3>Hobbies &amp; Fun &#127757;</h3>
  <p>I like reading books, listening to music, going to the gym and traveling. 
    <ul>
      <li>reading helps me relax and discover new ideas, </li>
      <li>music sets the mood for the day.</li>
      <li>the gym gives me energy and discipline and </li>
      <li>traveling inspires me with new experiences and perspectives.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<h3>A Small Dream &#128062;</h3>
  <p>In the future, I dream of starting a foundation to help domestic animals. I love dogs and believe every pet deserve care and attention. My goal is to support pets that are left without owners and create a place where they can feel safe and find new families.</p>
